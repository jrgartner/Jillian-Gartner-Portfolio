# Jillian-Gartner-Portfolio

## Puropose: To build a portfolio webpage that gives a summary about who I am, displays certifications that I have obtained, and highlights past projects that I have completed. 

#Lessons learned: When building this website I learned how to create a fixed nav bar to the top of the screen (taken off since it messes with moving to sections within the webpage), learned about rem for text, better understood flex.
